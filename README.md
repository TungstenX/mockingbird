# CicRegistration
Proof of skills for 8 BIT PLATOON

# Introduction
This is a web service to demonstrate my skills as a back-end developer

The specific technologies involved are:
- Git (ver 2.7.4.)
- Apache Maven (ver 3.9.9. - not the sucky one shipped with Netbeans &#245;.&#212;)
- Java Persistence API (JPA)
- JBoss / WildFly Application Server (ver 10.1.0 - Final)
- EJB Session Beans
- JAX-WS
- Passion with a sprinkling of unicorn horn

# Development
I use my trusty Netbeans 8.2 on Ubuntu 16.04. I developed the solution against Wildfly 10.1.0.

## Assumptions
(Actually only one)
- Only one email per email address will be loaded, e.g. one invoice for a specific person. Thus no bulk emails to be loaded.

## Time allocation
The following is my time allocated to this project:
- 10 minutes: Download and install Wildfly 10.1.0 on Ubuntu 16.04 (64 bit)
- 2.5 hours: Coding the solution
- 1 hour: Fighting with Netbeans, Wildfly and H2 to get solution to run - [Machine 0 : Rage Against 3]
- 10 minutes: Download and install Ready! API 1.9.0 (Yip, you guess it, on Ubuntu 16.04 (64 bit))
- 1 minute: Test web services
- 2.5 hours: Fighting JUnit to run in a test container - [Machine 1 : Rage Against 0] (Left my futile efforts in the files as comments)
- 30 minutes: Packaging and prettying up everything

# WSDL
After deploying, the wsdl can be found at http://localhost:8080/CicRegistration-0.0.0/CicRegistrationEngine/CicRegistrationEngine?wsdl

(Port depending on your Wildfly set up)

## Thanks
It was an honour to have built this demonstration for you to evaluate
