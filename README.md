# Mocking Bird
Proof of skills for AG

# Introduction
This is a simple java app to demonstrate my skills as a back-end developer

The specific technologies involved are:
- Git (ver 2.7.4.)
- Apache Maven (ver 3.9.9. - not the sucky one shipped with Netbeans &#245;.&#212;)
- Passion with a sprinkling of unicorn horn

# Development
I use JetBrain's Intellij IDEA 2017.3.4 on Linux Mint 18.2.

## Assumptions
(Actually only one)
- Only one entry per user in the user.txt file.

## Time allocation
The following is my time allocated to this project:
- 2.5 hours: Coding the solution
- 30 minutes: Packaging and prettying up everything

# Usage
`java -jar mockingbird-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar </path/to/user/file> </path/to/tweet/file>`


## Thanks
It was an honour to have built this demonstration for you to evaluate
